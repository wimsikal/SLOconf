        <p>We expect participants of SLOConf to conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner at all times. This means:</p>

          <li>Respect others views whether they do/don’t align with yours</li>
          <li>Display empathy towards other community members</li>
          <li>Be respectful of others in the public & private media</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Don't:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Make personal or political attacks</li>
          <li>Harass another person, whether publicly or privately</li>

          <li>Use another person's property whether physical or electronic, without their permission</li>
          <li>Do any other actions that can be interpreted as inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Permission and consent can be revoked at any given time. Once it has been revoked, it is no longer acceptable to continue a certain act, conversation or interaction with all involved parties whom no longer wish to take part.</p>
        <p><strong>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the organizers immediately at coc@sloconf.com.</strong></p>
        <p>SLOConf is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), location, or technology choices.</p>
        <p>We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate anywhere, including talks, chat rooms, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
        <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images on any media, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, sustained disruption of talks or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
        <p>Sponsors and speakers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. Sponsors and speakers may not use sexualized images, activities, or other material during their talks or any media in relation to the conference.</p>
        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from any private, online conference platforms.</p>
        <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference platforms.</p>
